# florilegium in JavaScript — live part-title pages for ePub

A hand port of the grown composition from Lua to plain JavaScript (ES5 in the bundle, no
dependencies), made to put florilegium gardens into ePub books. Scope: theme `flora`, the
page without a header, no animation, no initials. The SVG it writes is **byte for byte** the
one `svg.lua` writes for the same options.

Why a port, when `web/` already runs the Lua in the browser through wasmoon: an ePub
can't load a WebAssembly runtime from a CDN, and most e-readers run only a small subset of
JS. The port is one self-contained file (`dist/florilegium-garden.js`, ~120 KB) that an
ePub ships next to its XHTML.

## How it is used in a book

A part-title page carries a static garden (an image inside an `<svg>` wrapper, grown on a
120 × 200 mm sheet) and the part's title. `src/shmuc.js` measures the reader's page, grows
the garden with the same seed on a sheet of the page's proportions, and swaps it in.
With scripts off, or on any error, the image stays: the page works without the script.

```html
<svg data-florilegium="7 1F3A93 C0392B autumn" viewBox="0 0 120 200" ...>
  <image href="garden-7.svg" .../>
  <text class="flo-label">Part II</text><line class="flo-rule"/><text class="flo-name">…</text>
</svg>
<script src="florilegium-garden.js"></script>
```

`data-florilegium` is `seed ink accent [season] [novisitors]`. The engine alone is
`FlorilegiumGarden.page(options)`, with the options of `svg.lua`'s `M.page`; it returns
`{ svg }`.

## Files

- `src/detmath.js`, `lua/detmath.lua` — the same math in both languages (sin, cos, atan,
  atan2, log, exp, pow after fdlibm). The built-in ones of browsers and glibc differ in the
  last bit, and the garden would grow differently.
- `src/fmt.js` — `%.Nf` as printf does it (exact halves to even).
- `src/ink.js`, `src/flora.js`, `src/grow.js` — ports of `ink.lua`, `flora.lua`, `grow.lua`.
- `src/page.js` — TeX lengths, xcolor colors, the page layout, PDF operators to SVG
  (`svg.lua`, `florilegium.lua`).
- `src/shmuc.js` — the part-title script described above.
- `tools/bundle.js` — everything in one file, `dist/florilegium-garden.js`.
- `tools/rewrite_pow.py` — rewrites `a ^ b` in Lua to `__pow(a, b)`, so the reference can
  use detmath's pow (Lua's `^` on numbers can't be overridden).
- `lua/ref_page.lua` — the reference page: the repo's Lua with detmath swapped in.

## Cross-checks

The tests rebuild the reference from the repo's own `*.lua` on every run (through
`rewrite_pow.py`, into a temp dir), so they always check the port against the current Lua.
They need `node`, `python3` and `texlua` (or any Lua 5.4: `LUA=lua5.4`).

    node test/detmath_cross.js   # ~200 000 inputs, JS and Lua agree in every bit
    node test/fmt_cross.js       # 300 019 numbers
    node test/ink_cross.js       # 423 lines
    node test/flora_cross.js     # 186 cases, every primitive
    node test/page_cross.js      # 96 pages: formats, mirror, seasons, density — byte for byte
    node test/page_cross.js quick

The reference with detmath grows the same garden as the original florilegium (glibc math)
on seeds 1 and 8.

**Not kept in sync automatically**, like `postscript/`: a change to a primitive or to
`grow.lua` has to be made here too. `page_cross.js` says when it is needed.

Then rebuild the bundle:

    node tools/bundle.js
